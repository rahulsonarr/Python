The given function is a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a positive integer `n`. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`.

In the function:

```python
def calculate(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * calculate(n - 1)
```

The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial:

1. The base case is `n == 1`. When `n` is `1`, the function simply returns `1`. This is the stopping condition for the recursion.
2. For `n > 1`, the function returns `n` multiplied by the result of calling `calculate(n - 1)`. This is the recursive step, where the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1`.

The recursive call keeps reducing `n` by `1` in each step until it reaches the base case (`n == 1`), at which point it starts unwinding the recursion and computing the final result.

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how the function works:

Example 1:
```python
result = calculate(5)
print(result)
```
Output:
```
120
```
Explanation: `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`, and the function returns `120`.

Example 2:
```python
result = calculate(1)
print(result)
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: The base case is reached when `n == 1`, and the function returns `1`.

Example 3:
```python
result = calculate(0)
print(result)
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: By convention, `0!` is defined to be `1`, so the function returns `1` when `n == 0`.

Please note that this function will work correctly only for positive integers as it doesn't handle negative inputs.
