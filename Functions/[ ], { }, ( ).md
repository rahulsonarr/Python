In Python, square brackets [], curly braces {}, and parentheses () are used to represent different data structures and perform various operations.

1. Square Brackets []:
Square brackets are primarily used to define and access elements in lists and other sequence types like strings and tuples. Lists are ordered collections of items, and each element in the list has an index associated with it, starting from 0.

Example of creating a list and accessing its elements:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3
```

2. Curly Braces {}:
Curly braces are used to define dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique.

Example of creating a dictionary and accessing its values using keys:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John
print(my_dict['age'])   # Output: 30
```

3. Parentheses ():
Parentheses serve multiple purposes in Python:

- They are used for grouping expressions and controlling the order of operations in mathematical expressions.

Example of using parentheses to control the order of operations:

```python
result = (2 + 3) * 4  # The expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first
print(result)  # Output: 20
```

- Parentheses are also used in function calls to pass arguments to functions.

Example of calling a function with arguments:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # Function call with arguments 3 and 5
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

- Additionally, parentheses are used in tuple creation. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable (their elements cannot be changed after creation).

Example of creating a tuple:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: 3
```

In summary, square brackets are used for lists, curly braces for dictionaries, and parentheses have various uses, including grouping expressions, function calls, and tuple creation.
