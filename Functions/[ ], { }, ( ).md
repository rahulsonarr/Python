In Python, `[]`, `{}`, and `()` are used to define different types of data structures:

1. `[]` - Square Brackets:
   - Denotes a list, which is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Lists are defined by enclosing comma-separated elements within square brackets.
   - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

2. `{}` - Curly Braces:
   - Denotes a dictionary, which is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined by enclosing key-value pairs within curly braces and separating them with colons.
   - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}`

3. `()` - Parentheses:
   - Used for multiple purposes, including defining tuples, enclosing function arguments, and controlling order of operations in mathematical expressions.
   - Tuples are immutable, ordered collections of elements, defined by enclosing comma-separated elements within parentheses.
   - Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`

Examples:

1. List:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
```

2. Dictionary:
```python
student = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 20, 'roll_number': 12345}
```

3. Tuple:
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

4. Function call with arguments:
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
```

5. Mathematical expression:
```python
result = (3 + 5) * 2
```

It's important to understand the context in which these symbols are used, as they have different meanings depending on where they are used in the code. Lists, dictionaries, and tuples are three commonly used data structures in Python, each serving different purposes and offering unique features.
