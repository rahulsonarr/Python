The term "list function" is not a specific built-in function in Python. However, there are several built-in functions that can be used to manipulate or work with lists, which are a fundamental data type in Python.

Here are some common built-in functions that can be used with lists:

1. `len()`: Returns the number of elements in a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(my_list))  # Output: 5
```

2. `append()`: Adds an element to the end of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

3. `extend()`: Extends the list by appending elements from another iterable.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.extend([4, 5])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

4. `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specified position in the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 10)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 2, 3]
```

5. `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value from the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

6. `pop()`: Removes and returns the element at a specified index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
item = my_list.pop(1)
print(item)  # Output: 2
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

7. `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list.

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 20]
index = my_list.index(20)
print(index)  # Output: 1
```

8. `count()`: Returns the number of occurrences of a value in the list.

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 20]
count = my_list.count(20)
print(count)  # Output: 2
```

9. `sort()`: Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order (in-place).

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 2]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

10. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements in the list (in-place).

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)  # Output: [3, 2, 1]
```

These are some of the commonly used built-in functions for working with lists in Python. Lists are versatile and widely used data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of elements efficiently.
