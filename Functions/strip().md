In Python, the `strip()` method is a built-in string method that is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) from a string. It returns a new string with the specified characters removed.

Here's the syntax of the `strip()` method:

```python
string.strip([characters])
```

Parameters:
- `characters` (optional): A string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If not provided, it removes leading and trailing whitespace.

The `strip()` method is particularly useful for cleaning up user input, removing unnecessary whitespace from strings, and processing text data.

Example 1: Removing leading and trailing spaces:

```python
text = "   Hello, World!   "
cleaned_text = text.strip()
print(cleaned_text)  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

Example 2: Removing specific characters:

```python
text = "....Hello, World!...."
cleaned_text = text.strip('.')
print(cleaned_text)  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

Example 3: Using `strip()` with custom characters:

```python
text = "abc123xyz"
cleaned_text = text.strip('abxyz')
print(cleaned_text)  # Output: "123"
```

The `strip()` method does not modify the original string; it creates a new string with the specified characters removed. If you want to remove only leading or trailing characters, you can use `lstrip()` (for leading) and `rstrip()` (for trailing) methods.
