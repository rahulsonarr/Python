A nested loop is a loop that is placed inside another loop. It allows you to perform more complex iterations by repeating a set of instructions multiple times within another loop. Nested loops are used to process multidimensional data structures, perform combinations, generate permutations, or analyze elements in multiple dimensions.

In Python, you can nest loops of any type (for loop inside a for loop, while loop inside a for loop, etc.). The inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of the outer loop. The number of iterations for each loop can be different, providing flexibility in solving various programming problems.

Here's the general syntax of a nested loop:

```python
for outer_var in outer_sequence:
    # Outer loop code
    for inner_var in inner_sequence:
        # Inner loop code
```

Example 1: Nested `for` loop to print all pairs of numbers from two lists:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [10, 20, 30]

for num1 in list1:
    for num2 in list2:
        print(num1, num2)
```

Output:
```
1 10
1 20
1 30
2 10
2 20
2 30
3 10
3 20
3 30
```

Example 2: Nested `while` loop to create a multiplication table:

```python
row = 1
while row <= 5:
    col = 1
    while col <= 5:
        print(row * col, end=' ')
        col += 1
    print()  # Move to the next row
    row += 1
```

Output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 
2 4 6 8 10 
3 6 9 12 15 
4 8 12 16 20 
5 10 15 20 25 
```

Nested loops are powerful and versatile constructs in programming, enabling you to handle more complex tasks that require repetitive processing of multidimensional data or nested structures. However, be cautious about excessive nesting, as it can lead to reduced readability and performance issues.
