The `len()` function in Python is a built-in function that returns the number of items in an object. The behavior of the `len()` function depends on the type of object it is applied to. Here are some common use cases of the `len()` function:

1. Strings: When applied to a string, `len()` returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters.

```python
string = "Hello, World!"
print(len(string))  # Output: 13
```

2. Lists and Tuples: For lists and tuples, `len()` returns the number of elements (items) in the list or tuple.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(len(my_list))  # Output: 5
print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 4
```

3. Dictionaries: For dictionaries, `len()` returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(len(my_dict))  # Output: 3
```

4. Sets: For sets, `len()` returns the number of elements in the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(len(my_set))  # Output: 5
```

5. Other Objects: The `len()` function can be used with other objects that support determining the number of elements or characters in them.

```python
my_variable = 12345
print(len(my_variable))  # Raises TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
```

Keep in mind that the `len()` function may not be applicable to all types of objects, and attempting to use it on objects that do not support determining their length may result in a TypeError. It is most commonly used with sequences like strings, lists, and tuples, as well as collections like dictionaries and sets.
