The `range()` function in Python is a built-in function used to generate a sequence of numbers. It returns an immutable sequence (in Python 3) or a list (in Python 2) of numbers from a specified start value (inclusive) to a specified stop value (exclusive), with an optional step value.

The syntax of the `range()` function is as follows:

```python
range([start], stop, [step])
```

Parameters:
- `start` (optional): The starting value of the sequence. If not provided, it defaults to 0.
- `stop`: The stop value of the sequence. The sequence will end before reaching this value.
- `step` (optional): The step value, which determines the increment between each number in the sequence. If not provided, it defaults to 1.

The `range()` function is commonly used in for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers. Here are some examples of using the `range()` function:

Example 1: Generating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (exclusive).

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

Example 2: Generating a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 10 (exclusive).

```python
for num in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
2
4
6
8
```

Example 3: Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10 (exclusive).

```python
my_list = list(range(1, 11))
print(my_list)
```

Output:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

The `range()` function is a powerful tool for generating sequences of numbers and is commonly used in various looping constructs and other scenarios where you need to work with numerical sequences in Python.
